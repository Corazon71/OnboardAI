Title: Coding Standards & Git Workflow

1. Python Guidelines
- Follow PEP8.
- Use 'Black' for formatting.
- Type hinting (Pydantic models) is mandatory for all new API endpoints.

2. Git Workflow
- Main Branch: 'main' (Protected).
- Feature Branches: 'feat/ticket-id-description'.
- Pull Requests: Must have 2 approvals. CI tests must pass before merge.

3. API Design
- Use RESTful conventions.
- All endpoints must return standard JSON envelopes: { "data": ..., "meta": ... }
- Versioning is done via URL prefix (e.g., /api/v1/).
