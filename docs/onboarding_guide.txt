1. Getting Started
Welcome to the team! Your first step is to configure your VPN credentials sent via email.
Once connected, access the internal portal at portal.internal.company.

2. Communication
- General queries: #eng-general on Slack
- Urgent production issues: #ops-incident (PagerDuty integrated)

3. Hardware Setup
MacBooks are pre-installed with Homebrew. Run `brew bundle` in the root of the 'dotfiles' repo to install standard tools (Docker, VS Code, Postman).

4. Access Rights
Request access to AWS Staging via the 'Identity Portal'. Approvals usually take 24 hours.
