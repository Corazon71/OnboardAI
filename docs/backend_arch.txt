Context: Microservices System

1. Overview

- Notification Service (Python/Celery): Async email and SMS dispatch.

3. Databases
- Primary: PostgreSQL (managed Azure SQL) for transactional data.
- Caching: Redis for session storage and frequent queries.
- Analytics: Snowflake (data synced nightly via ETL).
